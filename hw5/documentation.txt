superset_ips.py - the IPS system that prevents the Metasploit Superset Cookie RCE from working.
Extracts session cookies that are sent by the Apache Superset server and keeps them in a python set.
When a client sends a cookie, if it's not in the set, superset_ips.py drops the packet and closes the connection
because the cookie might have been maliciously forged (more information in the presentation).
